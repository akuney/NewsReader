A simple feed app using Backbone (models, collections, views, templates, routers), with a basic Rails app to kick it off. As such, most of the action is in app/assets/javascripts. The feeds themselves are collected using the Ruby Feed class.

The main page gives an index of 4 feeds. Three of them are real; the fourth one is a nonsense feed that's set to update on the refresh button, no more than once every 10 seconds.
